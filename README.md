# About
## Task Description
The goal of the task is to train a model for single-label classification of the land-cover classes as defined in EuroSat study. 

## Training Data
The training data includes the labels (via the directory structure) as well as 64x64 pixel Sentinel-2 image patches with 13 bands. Note that the resolution of all bands has already been harmonized to 10m.

## Test Data
It consists of ~4000 Sentinel-2 images that are not part of Eurosat. Your goal in this challenge is to obtain the best possible accuracy in land-cover classification for those images. Note that there are some differences between the train and test data. Sentinel-2 data is distributed at different processing levels.
